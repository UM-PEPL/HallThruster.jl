    Thruster
Struct containing information about a Hall thruster. This includes a `name`, `geometry` (a `Geometry1D` object), `magnetic_field` (radial magnetic field along
centerline, a function which takes z in meters and outputs B in Tesla), and a `shielded` (a flag indicating whether the thruster is magnetically-shielded).
